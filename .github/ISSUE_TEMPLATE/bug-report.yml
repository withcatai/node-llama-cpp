        Your bug can be investigated much faster if your code can be run without any dependencies other than `node-llama-cpp`.
        Issues without reproduction steps or code examples may be closed as not actionable.
        Please try to provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example ([link](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)), including a link to the model file you used if possible.
        Also, please enable enable debug logs by using `getLlama({debug: true})` to get more information.
